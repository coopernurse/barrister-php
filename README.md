## Installation

Install via composer:

```json
 { "todo" : "put composer require statement here" }
```

To write a client:

```php
$barrister = new \coopernurse\Barrister\Barrister();
$client    = $barrister->httpClient("http://example.org/service");
```

To expose a service:

```php
// substitute your interface .json file here
// use the 'barrister' command line tool to produce the json file
// from your IDL
$server = new \coopernurse\Barrister\Server("calc.json");

// bind your implementation classes to interface names
$server->addHandler("Calculator", new Calculator());

// will parse the raw POST data, invoke the correct
// handler function, and send the result as JSON
$server->handleHTTP();
```

## Dependencies

This library was developed using PHP 5.3.8 (MacOS) and tested on PHP 5.2.4 (Linux).  It uses the
`json_decode` and `json_encode` functions added in PHP 5.2.  

The client code uses the PHP `curl` functions. Run: `php -m | grep curl` from the command line to 
conform that your PHP install has curl availble.  Alternately you can run: `phpinfo()` from a script.

If you are using a version of PHP older than 5.2, please download a JSON library that provides
`json_decode` and `json_encode` functions.  Facebook put the PEAR JSON library on github here:
